LITIV *utils* Module
--------------------
This module is the spiritual equivalent of OpenCV’s “core”, and was at the root of the framework's creation. It contains miscellaneous utilities needed by other modules (e.g. OpenGL wrappers, platform wrappers, distance functions, C++11/14 compatibility tricks). In other words, this is a compacted gold mine for other programmers who might dabble in related computer vision work.

Here is a non-exhaustive (and probably not fully up-to-date) list of features:

This module also links all external dependencies for the framework, meaning that executables only have to link to this target (along with other LITIV targets, as needed) to fully link to, e.g., OpenCV. Also, note that most important CMake variables have symbol entrypoints in the [defines.hpp.in](./include/litiv/utils/defines.hpp.in) file, which is converted by CMake into an actual header file.
